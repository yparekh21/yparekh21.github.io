		<h2>CRAP Website Discovery and Evaluation</h2>
		
		
		<div style="border: 2px solid black;">
		<h3><a style="color: green" href="https://www.uat.edu/">University of Advancing Technology</a></h3>
		
		<p>This website is the home page for the University of Advancing Technology. It provides the user with multiple links regarding various announcements, news, and basic navigation to various information. 
		This site utilizes heavy graphics along with a side scroll to access various elements.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>C</b> - The website focused on displaying flatter colors, such as black, grey, and white. The graphics on the page were the areas where they displayed the most color by utilizing the basic primary colors which did contrast well.</li>
			<li><b>R</b> - The prominence of using the flat colors that were mentioned are repetitively shown throughout the website. The formatting becomes less repetitive as the user scrolls through the page. The various links displayed throughout the page
			begin to change in design. This change in design creates almost a disassociative environment and lacks repetition in formatting.</li>
			<li><b>A</b> - This page does not follow aligment placements but rather scatters elements throughout the page. The general continuity of alignment is not met creating a displeasing display to the user.</li>
			<li><b>P</b> - The spacing of images, text, and titles is formatted decently. However, the placement of the text does not catch the eyes of users. The news and announcements is to low in the page seems "unimportant" while other elements are displayed with greater emphasis in size.
			The spacing of the text is done well.
		</ul>
		</div>

		<h3><a style="color: green" href="https://spotify.design/">Spotify Design</a></h3>
		
		<p>This website utilizes the principles of CRAP very well and provides a visually appealing display to users. The design of Spotify provides all the correct elements that a user of their service would want to use.
			This specific website provides information as to how Spotify achieves it's renowned appeal, as well as different stories and tools that designers of this company use.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>C</b> - The website uses various colors paired with abstract designs and bold black text to offer a readable environment. The utilization of size is very important to Spotify. To emphasize points by increasing font size and lowering font sizes for informational text or captions is great practice.
				This allows the user to be drawn in to the material of the website regardless if they have any purpose for their site. </li>
			<li><b>R</b> - Throughout the Spotify applications and websites, they repeat their use of formatting techniques as seen in text, color, font, and shapes. This allows the user to trademark their style and to appeal closer to the company and products.
				The use of bold and thin text paired with various contrasting colors and shapes offers an minimal yet stern look.</li>
			<li><b>A</b> - Alignment is another key things that Spotify instills throughout their system. Keeping each item, whether it be tools, graphics, or various elements, they make sure to provide clear alignment for clarity purposes.</li>
			<li><b>P</b> - The proximity of all the elements is also so great. Nothing is overlapping in terms of visual stimulation and everything is easily perceiving with a quick glance. The user does not need to spend time interpreting details but rather can cohesively understand the general layout.</li>
